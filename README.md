# Data-Architecture

In this project, I used US Flight Delays dataset, which contains information about flight schedules and delays across multiple airlines and airports in the United States. I  performed an exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain insights into flight delays, identify patterns, and provide valuable information for airline companies and passengers.
